# Ethereal Inventories

**WARNING:** This mod is still in development, and as the mod icon indicates, not ready for release. You shouldn't use it unless you know what you are doing. If you do intend to use this now, always keep backups of your worlds in case of inventory loss.

A mod that adds etherinvs! Etherinvs, a.k.a. ethereal inventories, are magical boxes that safely contains your items once you die. This mod is inspired by death chest mechanisms and pretty much acts as an unique take to them.
